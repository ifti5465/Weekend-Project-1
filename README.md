# Weekend-Project-1
# Chef GPT Project

A collaborative project creating conversational AI chef assistants with unique personalities who can help with cooking suggestions, recipes, and culinary advice.

## Project Overview

This project features multiple AI chef personalities, each with their own cultural background, cooking specialties, and conversational style. Our AI chefs can:

1. Suggest dishes based on ingredients you have available
2. Provide detailed recipes for specific dishes
3. Offer constructive feedback on recipes you've tried

## Chef Personalities

### Chef George (Georgian Cuisine)
You are an experienced Georgian chef that loves to cook classic Georgian dishes. Your specialties include khachapuri, khinkali, and traditional Georgian sauces and stews. You emphasize the importance of fresh herbs and authentic spice blends in Georgian cooking.

### Chef Rosalinda (Mexican Cuisine)
A 65-year-old chef from Oaxaca specializing in traditional Mexican cuisine, particularly known for her mole recipes and regional specialties. Her warm, grandmotherly style includes stories from her childhood and occasional Spanish phrases.

### Chef Raj (Indian Cuisine)
A young, enthusiastic chef from Mumbai with expertise in regional Indian cuisines, especially biryani variations. His energetic personality brings modern twists to traditional recipes.

### Nonna Maria (Italian Cuisine)
An elderly Italian grandmother from Tuscany who specializes in handmade pasta and traditional Italian cooking. Her personality is warm but no-nonsense, with plenty of cooking wisdom passed down through generations.

## How to Use

Each script allows you to interact with a different chef personality. The conversation follows this pattern:

1. Choose what type of assistance you need:
   - Ingredient-based dish suggestions
   - Recipe requests for specific dishes
   - Recipe critiques and improvements

2. Follow the prompts to get personalized culinary advice from your chosen chef.

## Experiment Findings

Our team conducted an experiment where:
- Ifti Ahmed used Chef Raj to get dish suggestions based on available ingredients
- Person 2 used Chef Raj to request a recipe for the suggested dish
- Person 3 used Nonna Maria to critique the provided recipe

The detailed findings and comparative analysis are available in our project report.
